Turn math practice into a fun daily habit! Count with Kids helps children build confidence with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through colorful, distraction-free exercises.

Set the difficulty to match your child's level — from simple sums up to 10 all the way to challenging problems up to 1000. Choose how many problems per session, add an optional countdown timer, and watch your child improve day by day.

WHAT MAKES IT SPECIAL:

- Instant feedback — correct answers appear right away so kids learn from mistakes
- "Clean Sheet" celebrations when they get every answer right
- Three fun themes — Dinosaur, Unicorn, or Penguin — to keep kids engaged
- Built-in dashboard with charts to track progress over time

DESIGNED FOR PARENTS AND KIDS:

Pick from four operations, adjust the counting range, and set the number of problems. Whether your child is just starting with numbers or already tackling multiplication tables, Count with Kids grows with them.
