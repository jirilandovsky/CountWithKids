### "Count with kids" mobile app

I want to create a mobile app for iPhone that helps children to practice counting using gamification.
Application will have 3 main menu items on the bottom edge of the screen - counting, dashboard and settings.
There will be a page of examples generated (for specifications of examples on page see "Settings" below) and the application wil count how long it takes to finish the page and also number of errors.
The dashboard will contain average number of errors and average time to finish the page. The last metrics is number of "clean sheets" - i.e number of pages finished without sny error.
Each of these metrics will be posible to see per day, week, month, year.
The metrics will be shown as number and nar chart - similar to Apple Health and stats about walking distance for example.
The metrics (dasboards) need to take into consideration settings of examples complexity - i.e. counting to 10 with "plus" examples only nees to have a separate dasboard from counting to 20 with all 4 mathematical 
Examples will be presented one example per line (number of lines is a part of settings), where user (i.e. the kid) types in the result using numerical keyboard into empty box at the end of the line

### Graphic Design
As an inspiration for fonts, colour scheme use website https://www.kennedy-center.org/education/mo-willems/
Graphics needs to have two versions:
- dinosaur theme for boys
- unicorn theme for girls

### Settings
User can choose from several difficulty levels:
- Counting to 10, Counting to 20, Counting to 100, Counting to 1000
- User can choose what mathematical operations are allowed: +, -, /, *
- User can set how many examples will be on one page - from 1 to 10
- User can set deadline in seconds for finishing a page

### Languagues
App needs to be in English, Czech, Hebrew

### General instructions:
Optimise the app for Apple App store only (there is no plan to release it as Android app)
Ask questions if my request is underspecified
Prepare an analysis and the plan first and review it before execution
For execution use task list and 5 agents
